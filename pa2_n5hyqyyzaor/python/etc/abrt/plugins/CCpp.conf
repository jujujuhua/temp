# created.

# Save full coredump? If set to 'no', coredump won't be saved
# and you won't be able to report the crash to Bugzilla. Only
# useful with CreateCoreBacktrace set to 'yes'. Please
# note that if this option is set to 'no' and MakeCompatCore
# is set to 'yes', the core is still written to the current
# directory.
